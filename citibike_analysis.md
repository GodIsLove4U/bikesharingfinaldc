## Additional Information about bike sharing

### What is bike sharing?

### Historical Data
Bike sharing gained its popoularity in 2007, when Tulsa, OK started its program. However, the ideology behind using bikes as a source of transportation, exercise, socialization and recreation have been around, on a national and international level, for decades. In the United States, New York City is the gold standard for bike sharing programs. This is due, in large part, to the need for navigating thru the city in ways that save time and space. New York City is a central location for commerce, education and vacation. Add to that, the cities population is 8.4 million, ditributed over 300 square miles. So, real estate is at a premium, which affects the ability to navigate the city with a car. 

Des Moines, IA has a specific interest in starting a bike sharing program and are looking at data from New York City's program to make the decision. This study and approach is useful. Although these two cities are very different, they share some comminalities, see below

### Bike sharing program benifits
It turns out quality bike share programs can have a huge positive impact on cities. Bike sharing relies on a system of self-service bike stations. Users typically check out a bike using a membership or credit/debit card. They can then ride to their destination and park the bike in a nearby docking station.

According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, bike share proagms icrease the visibility of cyclists which makes riding safer for everyone. It also helps improve bicycling and walking infrastructure within those cities. NYC has the most riders in a day, at 100,000. 

With 35 million trips in 2017 and strong year-on-year growth since 2010, bike share is gaining hold as a transportation option in cities across the U.S. Significant ridership in an ever-widening collection of cities and clear indications of cross-over use between bike share and traditional bus and rail transit indicate that bike share can provide an essential mobility option for people in U.S. cities. https://nacto.org/bike-share-statistics-2017/
