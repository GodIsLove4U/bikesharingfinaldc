This Tableau story includes information of the analysis I performed on New York City's bike sharing data in August 2019. It provides details on the number of users, ages, length of trip and bike utilized. This information was important to analyze for the Des Moines proposal I've prepared for the Board. We would like to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines and wanted to provide data to our board for them to decide and secure funding. 

The analysis provides some great insights into the bike sharing phenomenon, along with use cases and the benefits for bringing this means of transportation to a city, like ours, that would benefit from adopting this program. The summary will answer questions about population, demographics, economy, tourism and transportation.

## Additional Information about bike sharing

**_Bike Sharing & Historical Data_**
Bike sharing gained its popularity in 2007, when Tulsa, OK started its program. However, the ideology behind using bikes as a source of transportation, exercise, socialization and recreation have been around, on a national and international level, for decades. In the United States, New York City is the gold standard for bike sharing programs. This is due, in large part, to the need for navigating thru the city in ways that save time and space. New York City is a central location for commerce, education and vacation. Add to that, the city's population is 8.4 million, distributed over 300 square miles. So, real estate is at a premium, which affects the ability to navigate the city with a car. 

Des Moines, IA has a specific interest in starting a bike sharing program and are looking at data from New York City's program to make the decision. This study and approach are useful. Although these two cities are very different, they share some commonalities, see below
    -Both are the lead/major city within their state.
    -They are the main tourist attraction for the state
    -It's a metropolitan area
    -The population in city is highest in the state https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/desmoinescityiowa 

**_Bike sharing program benefits_**
It turns out quality bike share programs can have a huge positive impact on cities. Bike sharing relies on a system of self-service bike stations. Users typically check out a bike using a membership or credit/debit card. They can then ride to their destination and park the bike in a nearby docking station.

According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, bike share programs increase the visibility of cyclists which makes riding safer for everyone. It also helps improve bicycling and walking infrastructure within those cities. NYC has the most riders in a day, at 100,000. 

With 35 million trips in 2017 and strong year-on-year growth since 2010, bike share is gaining hold as a transportation option in cities across the U.S. Significant ridership in an ever-widening collection of cities and clear indications of cross-over use between bike share and traditional bus and rail transit indicate that bike share can provide an essential mobility option for people in U.S. cities. https://nacto.org/bike-share-statistics-2017/ 

## Conclusion 
Based on our research, bike sharing has more benefits than negatives. While we've looked at the challenges we face in our world currently, which COVID-19 and sharing measures, there are still many benefits. We will put new cleaning and decontamination measures in action. This will include stations with cleaning products, garbage cans and gloves. We will also have a team to perform regular and daily cleaning of the bikes. 

Below is a map of the proposed bike station locations. This is based on our research on transportation needs, popular tourist locations, parking and public transportation. 

Our economy plays a huge part in affordability of any type of transportation program. Due to the recent loss of jobs, bikes will assist in bridging the transportation gap. Bikes are more affordable and offer health benefits. We will also look at different types of biking, such as scooters and electric-powered bikes for those in need of something different. 

We look forward to the support of our Board. We're excited for this opportunity to offer bike sharing to our residents and visitors!
